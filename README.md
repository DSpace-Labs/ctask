# ctask - a collection of DSpace curation tasks #

Repo contains tasks in various stages of development consequently stability and maturity. Some are interrelated and likely destined for task 'suites', others not.

Most of these tasks are direct responses to the expanding service needs of MIT's production DSpace IRs.

Look for README files in sub-projects for details. Feel free to adopt/fork, etc but use at your own risk.

Unless otherwise noted, assume tasks require a DSpace 1.8 system.
